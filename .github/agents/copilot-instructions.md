## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `project/.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Project constitution |
| `project/specs/NNN-feature/spec.md` | Feature specification |
| `project/specs/NNN-feature/plan.md` | Technical plan |

## Commands

<!--
  Only include commands for technologies actually in use.
-->

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
[command]

# Run tests
[command]

# Build for production
[command]
```

### Database

```bash
# Run migrations
[command]

# Seed data
[command]
```

---

## Code Style

<!--
  Language-specific conventions.
  Only include for languages actually in use.
-->

### [Language]

- [Naming convention]
- [File organization]
- [Import order]

### Comments

- Use English for code comments
- Use Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) for business logic explanations
- Include "why" not just "what"

---

## AI Agent Instructions

### Do

- Follow spec/plan/tasks exactly
- Ask for clarification when ambiguous
- Reference specific documents when making decisions
- Flag potential consistency issues

### Don't

- Add features not in specification
- Skip SDD stages
- Assume requirements not explicitly written
- Hallucinate APIs or data structures

### Context Priority

1. Studio Constitution (`studio/constitution/constitution.md`)
2. Project Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
3. Feature Spec (`specs/NNN-feature/spec.md`)
4. Feature Plan (`specs/NNN-feature/plan.md`)
5. Feature Tasks (`specs/NNN-feature/tasks.md`)
